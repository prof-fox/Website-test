            <h2>Understanding Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.</p>
            <p>Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.</p>
            <p>Some key aspects of cybersecurity include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Network Security:</strong> Protecting the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data as it is transmitted across or accessed from networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Security:</strong> Ensuring that software and applications are secure from threats throughout their lifecycle.</li>
                <li><strong>Information Security:</strong> Protecting the data stored on devices and in databases from unauthorized access and breaches.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>Some of the most common types of cyber threats include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> A type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid.</li>
                    <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To protect against these threats, individuals and organizations should:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use strong, unique passwords and change them regularly.</li>
                    <li>Keep software and systems updated with the latest security patches.</li>
                    <li>Educate employees and users about recognizing and avoiding phishing attempts.</li>
                </ul>
